# django_book_app
Book blog application.

# Installation:
``` python manage.py runserver ```

# Project details: 
## Main features:
Users can publish the books they read alongside their review (/:star:️:star:️ :star:️ :star:️ :star:️ ). Users can see the books read by other users, compare the reviews for each book, search for a book, etc. I was thinking of adding the API to get the picture of the book cover and the book description.
